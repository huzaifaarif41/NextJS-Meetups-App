Revalidate needs a number and this number is the number of seconds, NEXTJS will wait until it regenerates this page for incoming request. It means this page is not just be generated during build process but also be generated every couple of seconds on the server, if there are requests for this page. So, if data can change in every 1 hour, so it changed to 3600 and if data changes in every one second so it should be initialized to 1. It ensures that this page could be updated after deployment\n\n  };\n} //if you need to add data fetching to a page component, you can do by exporting a special function from inside your page component file and its only work in page component files and not on regular components, but only work in component files inside the pages folder\n//it has to be called getStaticProps and NextJs first of all, call getStaticProps function before its called the component function and getStaticProps have a job to prepare props for this page and this props could contain the data this page needs and its allowed to be asynchronous which means it waits until your data is loaded\n//In getStaticProps(),you can execute any code, that would normally only run on a server becuase any code here will never end on a client side and never execute on client side\n//in page component function, recieves a props object and the object will be the object you set as a props here \n\nexport default HomePage;","map":null,"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
